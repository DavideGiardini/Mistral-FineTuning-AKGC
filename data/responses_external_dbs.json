Rolph Spicer, a knight loyal to House Lannister, commanded the defending forces at the Crag and interacted with Robb Stark during the course of the battle.\\nFollowing his victory at the Crag, Robb Stark turned his attention to Seagard, a strategically important town located in the Riverlands. Once again, Tommen Baratheon acted as the defender king during the siege, while Robb Stark led the attacking forces as both commander and king. The outcome of the Siege of Seagard is not specified in the given context, but it is clear that it was a significant engagement in the ongoing conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters.\\\"[/INST]\\n\\nExtracted Triples:\", \"FS_triples\": \"(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolph Spicer) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)</s>\", \"FT_triples\": \"(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolf Spicer) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Rolf Spicer) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolf Spicer) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)</s>\", \"FT_FS_triples\": \"(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolph Spicer) - [INTERACTS] -> (Tommen Baratheon)\\n(Ralph Spicer) - [INTERACTS] -> (Robb Stark)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_50\": \"(Seagard) - [LOCATION] -> (riverlands)\\n(Seagard) - [LOCATION] -> (riverlands)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Roloph Spicer) - [INTERACTS] -> (Robb Stark)\\n(Roloph Spicer) - [INTERACTS] -> (Robb Stark)\\n(Roloph Spicer) - [INTERACTS] -> (Robb Stark)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_150\": \"(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Tommen Baratheon) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolfe Spicer) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Rolfe Spicer) - [ATTACKER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_300\": \"(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_KING] -> (Siege of Seagard)\\n(Rolfe Spicer) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of the Crag)\\n(Rolfe Spicer) - [INTERACTS_WITH] -> (Robb Stark)</s>\"}, {\"text\": \"[INST]Imagine being a Knowledge Graph constructor from unstructured text.\\nFollowing the schema provided, extract all the triples you can find in the text.\\nMake sure to mantain the formatting of the schema: \\\"(subject)-[PREDICATE]->(Object)\\\"\\n\\nSchema:\\n(House)-[ATTACKER, DEFENDER]->(Battle)\\n(House)-[ATTACKER, DEFENDER]->(Battle)\\n(Battle, Location)-[IS_IN]->(Location, Region)\\n(Knight, King)-[DEFENDER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_COMMANDER]->(Battle)\\n(Knight, King)-[DEFENDER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_COMMANDER]->(Battle)\\n(King)-[DEFENDER_KING, ATTACKER_KING]->(Battle)\\n(King)-[DEFENDER_KING, ATTACKER_KING]->(Battle)\\n(Person,Knight, King)-[BELONGS_TO]->(House)\\n(Person,Knight, King)-[HAS_STATUS]->(Status)\\n(Person,Knight,King)-[APPEARED_IN, DIED_IN]->(Book)\\n(Person,Knight,King)-[APPEARED_IN, DIED_IN]->(Book)\\n(Person, King, Knight)-[MEMBER_OF_CULTURE]->(Culture)\\n(Person, Knight, King)-[INTERACTS]->(Person, Knight, King)\\n(Person, Knight, King)<-[RELATED_TO]->(Person, Knight, King)\\n\\nContext:\\n\\\"Hey there, book lovers!

This battle was a turning point in the series, with the Night's Watch defending their stronghold against the Wildling army led by none other than the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder.\\nOn the Night's Watch side, we have Jon Snow as the main defender commander. He's got some serious history with the Wildlings, having interacted with Mance Rayder and the skinchanger Varamyr multiple times before the battle. There's also a mysterious connection between Jon and someone named Emmett, but details on that are scarce.\\nNow, let's talk about those Wildlings. Mance Rayder may have been the king and a defender commander, but he had some key players on his side. Varamyr, a powerful skinchanger, fought as an attacker commander alongside a fierce warrior named Harma. And it seems Varamyr had his own crew, with interactions mentioned between him and individuals named Thistle, Bump, and Haggon.\\nThe stage was set for an epic clash at Castle Black, with Jon Snow and the Night's Watch facing off against Mance Rayder, Varamyr, Harma, and their Wildling forces. But as for how it all went down and who emerged victorious? Well, you'll have to dive deeper into the lore to find out!

He interacts with both Tyene Sand and Nymeria Sand, two of the infamous Sand Snakes. It's clear that Garin is a true Martell through and through.\\nSpeaking of the Sand Snakes, Tyene and Nymeria are thick as thieves. They interact with each other frequently, probably plotting their next move or just enjoying some sisterly bonding time. And of course, they both belong to House Martell, carrying on the family legacy.\\nBut let's not forget about Doran Martell, the head honcho himself. He's got his hands full with the Sand Snakes, interacting with both Nymeria and Tyene on multiple occasions. I wonder what kind of mischief they get up to together? \\nInterestingly, Doran not only belongs to House Martell but also to House Nymeros Martell. I'm not entirely sure what the distinction is there, but it's cool to see the different branches of the family tree.\\nAll in all, the Martells seem like a tight-knit bunch, with plenty of interactions and connections within the family. It's no wonder they're such a formidable force in Dorne!\\nLet me know what you all think about the Martell family dynamics.

The exact reasons for the attack are unclear, but it is believed to be part of a larger strategy by Balon Greyjoy to expand his influence and territory.\\nThe outcome of the battle is yet to be determined, but the people of Winterfell are rallying behind their king, Robb Stark, and his brother Bran, in the hopes of repelling the Greyjoy attack. The betrayal by Theon Greyjoy has left many in shock, and the repercussions of this battle are sure to be felt throughout the kingdom.\\nIn other news, Aenys Frey, a knight of the realm, was seen interacting with Theon Greyjoy prior to the battle, though the nature of their conversation remains unknown.\\\"[/INST]\\n\\nExtracted Triples:\", \"FS_triples\": \"(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Bran Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Attack on Winterfell)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)</s>\", \"FT_triples\": \"(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS_WITH] -> (Theon Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Bran Stark) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Robb Stark) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER, DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)</s>\", \"FT_FS_triples\": \"(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Bran Stark) - [DEFENDER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_50\": \"(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Bran Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_150\": \"(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Balon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Bran Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Robb Stark) - [DEFENDER] -> (Battle of Winterfell)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)\\n(Aenys Frey) - [INTERACTS] -> (Theon Greyjoy)</s>\", \"FSFT_triples_300\": \"(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Bran Stark)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Robb Stark)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Balon Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Stannis Baratheon)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Edmure Redwyne)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Ser Meryn Trant)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Lord Rickard Molyneux)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Beric Dondarrion)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Joffrey Baratheon)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (George R.R Martin)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Euron Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Roose Bolton)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Balon Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Stannis Baratheon)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Edmure Redwyne)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Ser Meryn Trant)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Lord Rickard Molyneux)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Beric Dondarrion)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Joffrey Baratheon)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (George R.R Martin)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Euron Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Roose Bolton)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (Balon Greyjoy)\\n(Theon Greyjoy) - [ATTACKER] -> (St\"}, {\"text\": \"[INST]Imagine being a Knowledge Graph constructor from unstructured text.\\nFollowing the schema provided, extract all the triples you can find in the text.\\nMake sure to mantain the formatting of the schema: \\\"(subject)-[PREDICATE]->(Object)\\\"\\n\\nSchema:\\n(House)-[ATTACKER, DEFENDER]->(Battle)\\n(House)-[ATTACKER, DEFENDER]->(Battle)\\n(Battle, Location)-[IS_IN]->(Location, Region)\\n(Knight, King)-[DEFENDER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_COMMANDER]->(Battle)\\n(Knight, King)-[DEFENDER_COMMANDER,ATTACKER_COMMANDER]->(Battle)\\n(King)-[DEFENDER_KING, ATTACKER_KING]->(Battle)\\n(King)-[DEFENDER_KING, ATTACKER_KING]->(Battle)\\n(Person,Knight, King)-[BELONGS_TO]->(House)\\n(Person,Knight, King)-[HAS_STATUS]->(Status)\\n(Person,Knight,King)-[APPEARED_IN, DIED_IN]->(Book)\\n(Person,Knight,King)-[APPEARED_IN, DIED_IN]->(Book)\\n(Person, King, Knight)-[MEMBER_OF_CULTURE]->(Culture)\\n(Person, Knight, King)-[INTERACTS]->(Person, Knight, King)\\n(Person, Knight, King)<-[RELATED_TO]->(Person, Knight, King)\\n\\nContext:\\n\\\"The Osgrey family has a rich history of producing notable knights and kings who have served their house with honor and distinction.

The Stark army, known for their fierce warriors like Daryn Hornwood, who had a close relationship with Eddard Stark, launched a determined attack against their opponents.\\nOn the defending side, the Lannister forces were commanded by the experienced and cunning Tywin Lannister, who was assisted by his trusted brother, Kevan Lannister. The Lannisters, with their well-equipped and disciplined troops, stood ready to defend King Joffrey's claim to the throne.\\nEddard Stark, the head of House Stark, had several interactions with both King Joffrey Baratheon and Tywin Lannister prior to the battle, adding to the tension and animosity between the two sides. The stage was set for a fierce and bloody confrontation that would have far-reaching consequences for the realm.\\nAs the battle commenced, the Stark forces, driven by their loyalty to their house and their belief in their cause, charged forward with determination. The Lannister defenders, equally resolute, met them head-on, and the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded soon filled the air. The outcome of this pivotal battle would shape the future of Westeros and the fate of the great houses involved.\\\"[/INST]\\n\\nExtracted Triples:\", \"FS_triples\": \"(Harrion Karstark) - [ATTACKER_COMMANDER] -> (Battle of the Green Fork)\\n(Medger Cerwyn) -
