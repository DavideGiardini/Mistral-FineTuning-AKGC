*** KG_constructor ***
Train and Validation datasets used for finetuning the LLM.
Viewable at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Giardooo/KG_constructor
Built in "1. Dataset Creation.ipynb"
Used in "2. Mistral Finetuning.ipynb" for the first LLM finetuning

*** KG_constructor_FS ***
Train and Validation datasets used for finetuning the LLM with examples.
Viewable at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Giardooo/KG_constructor_FS
Built in "1. Dataset Creation.ipynb"
Used in "2. Mistral Finetuning.ipynb" for the second LLM finetuning

*** test.csv ***
contains the 400 observations that were used for testing the performances of the LLM, coming from the original 4 databases.
Built in "1. Dataset Creation.ipynb"
Used in "3. Inference.ipynb" for creation of responses.json

*** test_external_dbs.csv ***
contains the 200 observations that were used for testing the performances of the LLM, coming from the 2 external databases.
Built in "1. Dataset Creation.ipynb"
Used in "3. Inference.ipynb" for creation of responses_external_dbs.json

*** responses.json ***
json file containing inferences of the 400 test observations coming from the original 4 databases that were also used for training.
It is composed in this way:
- text: contains the prompt and context from which the LLM has to extract the triples
- triples: are the ground truth triples
- NF_triples: triples extracted from the base LLM (Non Finetuned)
- FS_triples: triples extracted from the base LLM with Few Shot prompting
- FT_triples: triples extracted from the Fine Tuned LLM
- FS_prompts: prompt used for the Few Shot prompting

*** responses_external_dbs.json ***
json file containing inferences of the 200 test observations coming from the 2 databases that were used only for test.
It is composed in the same way as responses.json
+ FT_FS_triples: triples extracted from the Fine Tuned LLM with Few Shot prompting
